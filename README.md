# Website-Classification
Web page classification has become a challenging task due to the exponential growth of the World Wide Web. As a result, high accuracy may not be achievable as URL contains minimal information. Further, noisy and irrelevant features present in URL demand feature selection methods for URL classification. Therefore, a technique will be robust to irrelevant features and will generalize the classification for wide range of websites.
